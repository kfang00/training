//Arithmetic operations
// +, -, *, /, %

//Operator overloading --> what an operator does depends on the values you use it with.
//adding numbers; joining strings and arrays

//Compound assignment operators
//-=; += etc

//Comparison operators

//Conditions

//Swift will only run the code inside each case
